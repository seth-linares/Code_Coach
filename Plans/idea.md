# Proposal Idea

Over this recent Christmas break, my brother and our cousins have been preparing for our technical interviews and trying to pick up new skills in general. This led us to find a site that we ended up really enjoying, named https://www.codewars.com/. Code Wars offered us the ability to pick up an assortment of problems using numerous languages and solve them while at the same time offering us a chance to compare scores and solutions and, at the same time, compete against friends on a leaderboard. This concept was new to us, and we enjoyed the fun of trying to race each other to finish complex code problems and see how many we could complete. 

When trying to figure out what our Senior Project should be, we realized that this site we had been using to learn programming and prepare for our interviews serves as a fantastic inspiration for something we could do ourselves that could be aimed at beginners to a language or even programming in general. 

We realized that one of the biggest challenges with the Code Wars format, especially when in the context of being a beginner to a language, is needing to go out inevitably and spend a lot of time looking up syntax and other aspects of coding that a newer programmer would be unfamiliar with. This takes up a lot of time and can often lead people down the path known as "tutorial hell," where they can get stuck trying to memorize and focus on pointless tutorials that ultimately take away from their ability to learn the foundational concepts likely holding them back.

Our proposed solution is to create a site that allows the user to go through coding problems with a tutor. While this would require another human in the past, with the advent of LLMs, the potential for integrating chatbots and AI into learning is finally a viable idea. Sites like Khan Academy have already begun incorporating GPT-4 into their learning programs and have shown that it can help teachers and students access education that was previously prohibitively expensive for most people. 

We aim to provide an environment in which students like us can come and use our website to improve the rate at which they improve in coding and use AI to replace the otherwise inadequate tutoring resources that sometimes confuse or overwhelm beginners. The goal is to provide code problems, a sandbox in which they can test their solutions, and a chatbot where they can have it read over their code and answer any questions they might have. 




## How to get code problems

Since the concepts/ideas of programming are legal to reuse, we plan to review Leet Code and Code Wars to gather up a list of topics and then create our own version of them that is more focused on teaching fundamentals rather than just being difficult to understand.

So we were planning to keep the difficulty in the range of 8 - 6 kyu, which on Code Wars is equivalent to very beginner problems up to problems that you might see in actual technical interviews. However, I want to reiterate that we will not be copying and pasting problems but instead using the concepts to write our own to avoid any legal issues.
