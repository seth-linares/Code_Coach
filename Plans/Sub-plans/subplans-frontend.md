# Frontend Development Sub-Plan

### 1. **Initial Setup and Project Structure**
   - **Development Environment Setup**: Setting up the development environment (Node.js, npm)
   - **React Application Creation**: Creating the React application with TypeScript
   - **Project Directory Structure**: Defining the project directory structure for components, services, utilities, and static assets
   - **Essential Libraries Configuration**: Configuring essential libraries (e.g., React Router for navigation, state management library)

### 2. **Core Functionality and Component Development**
   - **Global State Management**: Choosing and setting up a state management solution (Context API, Redux, etc.)
   - **Reusable Component Library**: Developing a library of reusable UI components (buttons, modals, input fields)
   - **Layout and Navigation**: Implementing the main layout, header, footer, and navigation components
   - **Routing and Dynamic Page Generation**: Setting up React Router, configuring routes for each page, and dynamic page templates

### 3. **Authentication and User Account Management**
   - **Login/Registration Components**: Building forms and integrating authentication services
   - **2FA Setup and Verification**: Implementing components for setting up and verifying Two-Factor Authentication
   - **Profile Management**: Developing the profile page for personal information and API key management
   - **Settings/Account Management**: Components for managing user settings, including password changes and account deletion
   - **JWT and Session Management**: Handling JWT tokens, session management, and secure storage of tokens
        - Implement the handling of JWTs during login, including storing the token securely (preferably in HTTPOnly cookies if possible, or otherwise in localStorage with precautions against XSS).
        - Configure Axios or another HTTP client to automatically include the JWT in the Authorization header for all outgoing requests to protected backend endpoints.
   - **Login/Registration Components**: Enhance to process and handle JWTs upon successful authentication.
   - **Handling Token Expiry and Refresh**:
        - Implement mechanisms to detect when an access token has expired and either prompt the user to log in again or automatically refresh the token (if using refresh tokens).
   - **Logout Functionality**: Develop a logout feature that removes the JWT from the client storage, effectively ending the session.

### 4. **Problem Solving and Interaction**
   - **Coding Problems Index Page**: Components for listing problems with filters and search functionality
   - **Coding Problem Detail Page**: Integrating a code editor, problem description, and chatbot interface
   - **Problem Submission and Feedback**: Handling code submission, displaying execution results, and providing feedback
   - **Problem Attempt History and Detailed View**: Components for viewing attempt history and detailed feedback on submissions

### 5. **API Key Management**
   - **API Key Management UI**: Building interfaces for adding, deleting, and managing API keys securely
   - **Client-Side Security**: Implementing secure communication with the backend for API key operations
   - **Secure API Communication**: Ensure that all API requests involving API key management are securely authenticated using `JWTs`, enforcing that only the rightful owner can manage their API keys.

### 6. **Security Enhancements**
   - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Configuring CSP to prevent XSS attacks
   - **Data Protection**: Implementing best practices for protecting sensitive data on the client side
   - **Secure Storage and Transmission of JWTs**:
        - Implement strategies for the secure storage of JWTs on the client side, evaluating the trade-offs between `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and cookies.
        - Ensure HTTPS is used for all communications involving JWTs to protect them during transit.
   - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Verify that CSP does not interfere with the intended storage mechanism for JWTs or with the domains from which the application loads resources. 

### 7. **User Interface Design and Usability**
   - **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes
   - **UI/UX Best Practices**: Implementing navigation patterns, loading states, error handling, and user feedback mechanisms
   - **Accessibility**: Making sure the application is accessible according to WCAG guidelines
   - **Feedback for Authentication and Authorization Errors**: Design user-friendly error messages and feedback mechanisms for scenarios where authentication fails (e.g., invalid token or expired session) or the user attempts to access unauthorized resources.

### 8. **Additional Features and Pages**
   - **FAQs/Help Page**: Developing components for displaying frequently asked questions and contact forms
   - **Resource and Tutorial Page**: Components for listing educational resources and tutorials
   - **Optional Leaderboard Page**: If decided, implementing a leaderboard page to motivate users

### 9. **Optimization and Performance**
   - **Code Splitting**: Implementing code splitting to reduce initial load time
   - **Asset Optimization**: Techniques for optimizing images, fonts, and other static assets

### 10. **Testing and Deployment**
   - **Unit and Integration Testing**: Setting up testing frameworks (Jest, React Testing Library) and writing tests for components and utilities
   - **Build and Deployment Process**: Configuring the build process for production, including environment-specific configurations
   - **Deployment Strategy**: Planning the deployment to a web server or cloud platform, and automating deployment processes if possible
   - **Security Testing**:
        - Incorporate security testing to validate the proper handling, storage, and transmission of JWTs.
        - Test the application's behavior in response to expired or invalid JWTs, ensuring that the user experience remains intuitive (e.g., redirecting to login page, providing clear messages).
