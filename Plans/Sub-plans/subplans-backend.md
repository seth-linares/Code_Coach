# Backend Development Plan with Middleware Integration

### 1. **Initial Setup and Configuration**
   - **Environment Setup**: Install the .NET Core SDK, Visual Studio (or another IDE), Docker for container management, and any other necessary tools.
   - **Project Scaffolding**: Create the ASP.NET Core projects for the backend services and the sandbox environment, configuring the solution to include all necessary dependencies for JWT, Entity Framework (EF) Core, and any additional libraries.

### 2. **Database Design and EF Core Integration**
   - **Modeling and Migration**: Design the database schema in EF Core, creating models for Users, Problems, Submissions, API Keys, etc., and apply initial migrations to generate the database schema.
   - **Database Context Configuration**: Set up the `DbContext` for SQL Server integration, ensuring connection strings are securely stored and managed.

### 3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **JWT Authentication Setup**: Implement JWT token generation and validation, including the creation of the authentication middleware to parse and validate tokens on incoming requests.
   - **User Authentication Flow**: Develop the login and registration endpoints, incorporating logic to issue JWTs upon successful authentication.
   - **Authorization Policies**: Define roles or claims-based authorization policies for protecting API endpoints, integrating these policies through custom middleware or ASP.NET Core's built-in authorization mechanisms.

### 4. **Middleware for Extended Functionality**
   - **API Key Management Middleware**: Implement middleware to validate API key usage for designated endpoints, ensuring that requests have the appropriate API key attached when accessing sensitive operations.
   - **Error Handling Middleware**: Create a global error handling middleware to catch and format exceptions, providing a standardized error response structure for the API.
   - **Logging and Audit Middleware**: Develop middleware for logging request/response data and user activities, enhancing the audit logging capabilities mentioned in the project overview.

### 5. **Secure Code Execution Environment**
   - **Sandbox Setup**: Utilize Docker to set up a secure, isolated environment for executing user-submitted code, ensuring that the sandbox project is properly isolated from the main backend services.
   - **Sandbox Management API**: Implement an API within the sandbox project for managing code execution requests, integrating security measures to prevent abuse.

### 6. **API Development and Security**
   - **API Endpoint Creation**: Develop RESTful API endpoints for user management, problem management, submissions, and other features outlined in the project plan.
   - **Security Enhancements**: Integrate security practices, including HTTPS enforcement, CSP headers (where applicable), and input validation to protect against common vulnerabilities.
   - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for the API to prevent abuse and ensure service availability, particularly for endpoints related to code execution and API key management.
   - **Securing API endpoints**: beyond CSP headers, such as implementing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control which domains can access your API and protecting against SQL injection and other injection attacks.

### 7. **AWS and Docker Integration for Deployment**
   - **AWS Services Configuration**: Set up and configure AWS services (EC2, S3, Certificate Manager, KMS, WAF, Route 53) for hosting, storage, security, and DNS management.
   - **Containerization**: Dockerize the backend applications, preparing Dockerfiles for both the general backend services and the sandbox environment to streamline deployment and ensure consistency across environments.

### 8. **Testing and Documentation**
   - **Automated Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for the backend services, covering authentication flows, API endpoint functionality, and sandbox code execution.
   - **API Documentation**: Use Swagger or a similar tool to document the API, providing clear instructions for frontend developers and ensuring easy integration with the frontend.

### 9. **Deployment Planning and Execution**
   - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment, potentially using GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or AWS CodePipeline, to automate the deployment of both Dockerized applications to AWS.

### 10. **Maintenance and Scaling Strategy**
   - **Logging and Monitoring Setup**: Implement logging and monitoring solutions to track application health, user activities, and potential security incidents, using AWS CloudWatch or similar services.
   - **Scaling Considerations**: Plan for scalability, considering the separation of backend services and the database onto different instances or utilizing AWS RDS for the database to support future growth.
